# The Continuum Variability of SDSS-RM Quasars

## Aim

Investigate the following topics:
- What are the factors that influences the DRW parameters? Or, put it in another way, what can the measured DRW parameters tell us about quasars?
- Can DRW model describe the short timescale variation of quasars? What can the short timescale variations tell us about the accretion disk?

## Sample
