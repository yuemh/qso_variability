# The Continuum Variability of SDSS-RM Quasars

## Aim

Investigate the following topics:
- What are the factors that influences the DRW parameters? Or, put it in another way, what can the measured DRW parameters tell us about quasars?
- Can DRW model describe the short timescale variation of quasars? What can the short timescale variations tell us about the accretion disk
- Summarize the distribution of quasar variabilities

## Sample

Quasars: SDSS_RM quasars (849  quasars)

Photometric data should include:

- SDSS photometry
- SDSS DR7 spectrum
- CFHT legacy survey (g band)
- Pan-Starrs (shall we wait for DR2?)
- SDSS DR12 spectrum
- BASS

ALL quasars should have >11 year time baseline, with number of photometric points >80.
