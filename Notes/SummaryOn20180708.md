# The Continuum Variability of SDSS-RM Quasars

## Intro (Previous Studies)
There has been models, codes, observations on quasar continuum variability.

## Aim

Investigate the following topics:
- What are the factors that influences the DRW parameters? Or, put it in another way, what can the measured DRW parameters tell us about quasars?
- Can DRW model describe the short timescale variation of quasars? What can the short timescale variations tell us about the accretion disk
- Summarize the distribution of quasar variabilities

## Sample

Quasars: SDSS_RM quasars (849  quasars)

Photometric data should include:

- SDSS photometry
- SDSS DR7 spectrum
- CFHT legacy survey (g band)
- Pan-Starrs (shall we wait for DR2?)
- SDSS DR12 spectrum
- SDSS-RM
- BASS

ALL quasars should have >11 year time baseline, with number of photometric points >80.

### Combining different surveys
- SDSS photometry: PSF magnitude
- SDSS DR7 spectrum: integrate the spectrum and do a typical aperture correction, assuming a typical seeing.
- CFHT legacy survey (g band): use SDSS-RM to correct Ian's data
- Pan-Starrs (shall we wait for DR2?): Aperture mag. (Pan-Starrs has performed aperture correction)
- SDSS DR12 spectrum: integrate the spectrum and do a typical aperture correction, assuming a typical seeing.
- SDSS-RM: used as the standard
- BASS: use SDSS-RM to correct Ian's data

## Analyze

Use JAVELIN to measure the parameters.
