### Photometric point selection

- Bok/CFHT data are preferred. SDSS / Pan-Starrs data is adopted if there is no data within +/- 10 days around that point.
- Combine all the photometric data after correcting them to CFHT/MegaCam gS or iS.
- Photometric measurements with error < 0.05 mag are adopted.
- Output all photometric data to files
- Plot and mark unreliable points

...Since DR12 quasar catalog only have limited number of quasar properties, let's work on SDSS-RM quasar first.
