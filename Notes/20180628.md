### Things to do

- Combining photometry from Bok and CFHT: learn how to use CREAM.

- Run i band data and fit the dependence on rest-frame wavelength. Compare with previous result. Decide the correction factor.

- Fit all the results. Not only the relations, but also the distributions.

- Analyze the origin of the variability.
