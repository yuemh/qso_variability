### Dig the features

What feature to consider?

- Black hole mass
- Continuum luminosity (L_3000)
- Rest-frame wavelength
- Redshift
- Continuum slope (by L_XXXX / L_XXXX)
- Broad line EW (Halpha, Hbeta, MgII, CIV, Lya; by redshift bins. Let us try MgII today.)
- Broad line flux
- Broad line width
- tau
- sigma (mag)


Add on 06/23/2018:
- Try: use flux rather than mag: we should sigma (flux) and continuum flux at observed band as continuum flux
