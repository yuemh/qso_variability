### Light curve pre-selection and binning

- Before merging phot points of different surveys:

  (1) All photometric points observed at very close MJDs (<0.3 days) are combined; they are basically multiple exposures in one observation run, and are consistent within the measurement errors. In details, are grouped using Meanshift method, with a width of 0.3 days.
  
  (2) All phot points are corrected to CFHT MegaCam
  
- After merging phot points of different surveys:

  (1) All points with error > 0.1 mag
  
  (2) To rule out possible problematic points, all points that significantly deviate from the "expected" value are rejected. For a photometric point taken at t_i, we calculate the median value of all data taken at t_j, where |t_j-t_i|<50 days. If the photmetric data deviates from the median value by 0.5 mag, this point will not be used.
  
- Things to do:

  (1) Illustrate the distribution of: time baseline, number of photometric points, number of bad points


### Fitting the light curve

Use JAVELIN to fit thge light curve. Model: DRW; Output: sigma, tau, and their errors.
