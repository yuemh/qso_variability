### 1. Data

The photometric data used in this work is from these surveys:

- CFHT Legacy Survey (2003 - 2009) (by Ian): MegaCam gS / iS
- SDSS-RM (by Ian): CFHT MegaCam gS / iS, Bok 90Prime g' / i'
- Pan-Starrs
- SDSS Photometry

### 2. Crossmatch

All objects are matched to the info in "/data/allqsos_rmfield.fits"

- CFHTLS / SDSS-RM: pre-matched by Ian
- Pan-Starrs: matched to the StackObject catalog with a 2"
- SDSS: matched to the PhotoObjAll catalog with a 2"


### 3. Filter correction

All photometric data are converted to MegaCam gS / iS magnitudes,

- SDSS-RM quasars: using the stacked spectra of SDSS-RM project
- Other quasars: SDSS discovery spectra
