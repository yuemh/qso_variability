## Quasar Variability

This project is about the relation between quasar variabilities and other properties of quasar. Topics of interest include:

(1) Investigate the relation between DRW parameters and quasar properties
(2) Models beyond DRW (especially at very short timescales).

# Things to do: (06/08 - 07/10)

(1) Aperture correction (1 week)

(2) Try JAVELIN on CFHT data (3 days)

(3) Obtain photometry from other sky surveys (4 days)

(4) Filter correction (4 days)

(5) Run JAVELIN on all data. (1 week)


# Further things:

(1) Simulation

(2) Beyond DRW: structure func at very short timescale.
