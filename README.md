## Quasar Variability

This project is about the relation between quasar variabilities and other properties of quasar. Topics of interest include:

- Investigate the relation between DRW parameters and quasar properties
- Models beyond DRW (especially at very short timescales).

### Things to do: (06/08 - 07/10)

- Aperture correction (1 week)
- Try JAVELIN on CFHT data (3 days)
- Obtain photometry from other sky surveys (4 days)
- Filter correction (4 days)
- Run JAVELIN on all data. (1 week)


### Further things:

- Simulation
- Beyond DRW: structure func at very short timescale.
